The impressions of nature and wild life deeply moved my child imagination  prompting me to express them through drawing and sculpting with clay. These impressions  were my early steps toward becoming an artist. </p>
          <p>I grew up in Beijing,   China, where my father, a  biologist and a diplomat, had an assignment. Growing up in the capital of such  a rich and centuries old history inspired my young artistic soul strengthening  further my interests in art and making it my primary focus in life.<br />

            <p>Having spent a lot of time  studying human anatomy at school has helped me to narrow down my specialization  in sculpting. Human expressions and emotions, body physique and flexibility; I  strived to capture it all in my sculptures. My knowledge and understanding of  physical proportions, relational size, sculpting techniques and methods guided  me through my professional path prompting to excel with each new creation.</p>
            <p> However, it is the beauty of  nature, scent of the wind and sun, power of sand storms and color of homeland  air that fueled my inspiration and sustained my enormous devotion to art. I  hope my sculptures convey this passion to my audience. </p>
